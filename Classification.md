Design patterns are classified into three main categories: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral. This classification is based on the purpose and scope of the patterns, and it helps developers to better understand and apply the patterns in their software design.


Creational Patterns


Creational patterns deal with the creation of objects and the way they are instantiated. They provide solutions to problems related to object creation, such as:


How to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created?
How to create objects that are dependent on other objects?
How to create objects that have a complex initialization process?

Examples of creational patterns include:


Singleton pattern
Factory pattern
Builder pattern
Prototype pattern

Structural Patterns


Structural patterns deal with the composition of objects and the relationships between them. They provide solutions to problems related to object structure, such as:


How to compose objects to form a larger structure?
How to define the relationships between objects?
How to provide a way to access an object without exposing its internal structure?

Examples of structural patterns include:


Adapter pattern
Bridge pattern
Composite pattern
Decorator pattern

Behavioral Patterns


Behavioral patterns deal with the behavior of objects and the way they interact with each other. They provide solutions to problems related to object behavior, such as:


How to define the behavior of an object?
How to define the interactions between objects?
How to provide a way to extend the behavior of an object without modifying its class?

Examples of behavioral patterns include:


Observer pattern
Strategy pattern
Template method pattern
Visitor pattern
